# Mastering Bitcoin

Mastering Bitcoin is a book for developers and tihnker although the first two chapters cover bitcoin at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of bitcoin.

This repository contains the complete [first edition, second print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/Edition1Print2), published in December 2014, and the complete [second edition, second print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/second_edition_print2), published in July 2017, as published by O'Reilly Media in paperback and ebook formats.

# Reading this book (Where is the PDF?)

To read this book, see [book.asciidoc](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/book.asciidoc). Click on each of the chapters to read in your browser. This is not as convenient as reading a PDF or an ebook on your e-reader, for which there is a cost (see below).

The 2nd edition of "Mastering Bitcoin" is available under a CC-BY-NC-ND license, not a CC-BY-SA license.

It is deliberately not available as a PDF. Why? Because a PDF is a "derivative" product, which is what the ND prohibits. That's because the publisher (O'Reilly Media) is a for-profit publisher who puts considerable resources behind distributing the book. The book will eventually (within a year of publication) be released under a CC-BY-SA license, at which point the PDF format and translations will be allowed. Until then, making PDF copies violates the license and interferes with the publisher's (and the author's) ability to make a living. Furthermore, if you make it so the publisher can't recoup their investment, they will delay the release into CC-BY-SA.

Please don't create or distribute PDFs until the license is changed to CC-BY-SA. It is rare for a publisher to even agree to a CC-BY-NC-ND license. Don't make it harder for free culture by violating even that, already generous, license.
