== Colored Coins

The term _Colored Coins_ refers to a set of similar technologies that use bitcoin transactions to record the creation, ownership and transfer of extrinsic assets other than bitcoin. By "extrinsic" we mean assets that are not stored directly on the bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to bitcoin itself which is an asset intrinsic to the blockchain.

Colored coins are used to track digital assets as well as physical assets held by third parties and traded through colored coins certificates of ownership. Digital asset colored coins can represent intangible assets such as a stock certificate, license, virtual property (game items), or most any form of licensed intellectual property (trademarks, copyrights, etc). Tangible asset colored coins can represent certificates of ownership of commodities (gold, silver, oil), land title, automobiles, boats, aircraft, etc.

The term derives from the idea of "coloring" or marking a nominal amount of bitcoin, for example a single satoshi, to represent something other than the bitcoin value itself. As an analogy, consider stamping a $1 note with a message saying "This is a stock certificate of ACME" or "This note can be redeemed for 1 oz of silver" and then trading the $1 note as a certificate of ownership of this other asset. The first implementation of colored coins, named _Enhanced Padded-Order-Based Coloring_ or _EPOBC_ assigned extrinsic assets to a 1 satoshi output. In this way, it was a true "colored coin".

After _EPOBC_, more recent implementations of colored coins use the OP_RETURN script to store metadata about extrinsic assets. In a sense these systems are not true colored coins as no coins are "colored". Instead, transactions with OP_RETURN metadata are used to create and track ownership in conjunction with external data stores which associate the metadata to specific assets.

The two most prominent implementations of colored coins today are http://www.openassets.org/[_Open Assets_] and https://coloredcoins.org[_Colored Coins by Colu_]. These two systems use different approaches to colored coins and are not compatible. Colored coins created in one system cannot be seen or used in the other system.

==== Using Colored Coins

Colored coins are created, transfered and generally viewed in special wallets that can interpret the colored coins protocol metadata attached to bitcoin transactions. Special care must be taken to avoid using a colored coin related key in a regular bitcoin wallet, as the regular wallet may destroy the metadata. Similarly, colored coins should not be sent to addresses managed by regular wallets, but only to addresses that are managed by wallets that are colored-coin-aware. Both Colu and Open Assets systems use special colored-coin addresses to address this risk and to ensure that colored coins are not sent to unaware wallets.

Colored coins are also not visible to most general-purpose blockchain explorers. Instead, you must use a colored-coins explorer to interpret the metadata of a colored coins transaction.

==== Creating Colored Coins

Each of the colored coins implementations has a different way of creating colored coins, but they all provide similar functionality. The process of creating a colored coin asset is called _issuance_. An initial transaction, the _issuance transaction_ registers the asset on the bitcoin blockchain and creates an _asset ID_ that is used to reference the asset. Once issued, assets can be transferred between addresses using _transfer transactions_.

Assets issued as colored coins can have multiple properties. They can be _divisible_ or _indivisible_, meaning that the amount of asset in a transfer can be an integer (eg. 5) or have decimal subdivision (eg. 4.321). Assets can also have _fixed issuance_, meaning a certain amount are issued only once, or can be _reissued_, meaning that new units of the asset can be issued by the original issuer after the initial issuance.

Finally, some colored coins enable the issuance of _dividends_, allowing the distribution of bitcoin payments to the owners of a colored coin asset in proportion to their ownership.
