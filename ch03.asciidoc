== The Bitcoin Client

=== Bitcoin-Qt - The Reference Implementation, aka Satoshi Client

You can download the Satoshi Client from bitcoin.org. Depending on your operating system, it will be called bitcoin-qt or bitcoind. The reference client implements all aspects of the bitcoin system, including wallets, a transaction verification engine with a full copy of the entire transaciton ledger (blockchain) and a full network node in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. 

Go to http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet and select "Bitcoin-Qt" to download the reference client. Depending on your operating system, you will download an executable installer. For Windows, this is either a ZIP archive or an EXE executable. For Mac OS it is DMG disk image. Linux versions include a PPA package for Ubuntu or a TAR.GZ archive.

==== Bitcoin-Qt - Running the client for the first time

If you download an installable package, such as an EXE, DMG or PPA, you can install it the same way as any application on your operating system. For Windows, run the EXE and follow the step-by-step instructions. For Mac OS, launch the DMG and drag the Bitcoin-QT icon into your Applications folder. For Ubuntu, double-click on the PPA in your File Explorer and it will open the package manager to install the package. Once you have completed installation you should have a new application "Bitcoin-Qt" in your application list. Double-click on the icon to start the bitcoin client. 

The first time you run Bitcoin-Qt it will start downloading the blockchain, a process that may take several days. Leave it running in the background, until it displays "Synchronized" and no longer shows "Out of sync" next to the balance.

[TIP]
====
Bitcoin-Qt keeps a full copy of the transaction ledger (blockchain), with every transaction that has ever occured on the bitcoin network since its inception in 2009. This data set is several gigabytes in size (approximately 16GB in late 2013) and is downloaded incrementally over several days. The client will not be able to process transactions or update account balances until the full blockchain dataset is downloaded. During that time, the client will display "Out of sync" next to the account balances and show "Synchronizing" in the footer. Make sure you have enough disk space, bandwidth and time to complete the initial synchronization.

==== Bitcoin-Qt - Compiling the client from the source code

For developers, there is also the option to download the full source code, either as a ZIP archive or by cloning the authoritative source repository from Github. Go to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and select "Download ZIP" from the sidebar. Alternatively, use the git command line to create a local copy of the source code on your system. In the example below, we are cloning the source code from a unix-like command-line, in Linux or Mac OS:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
Cloning into 'bitcoin'...
remote: Counting objects: 31864, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12007/12007), done.
remote: Total 31864 (delta 24480), reused 26530 (delta 19621)
Receiving objects: 100% (31864/31864), 18.47 MiB | 119 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (24480/24480), done.
$
----

[TIP]
====
The instructions and resulting output may vary from version to version. Follow the documentation that comes with the code even if it differs from the instructions you see here and don't be surprised if the output displayed on your screen is slightly different from the examples here. 
====

When the git cloning operation has complete, you will have a complete local copy of the source code repository in the directory _bitcoin_. Change to this directory by typing +cd bitcoin+ at the prompt:

----
$ cd bitcoin
----
 
By default, the local copy will be synchronized with the most recent code which may be an unstable or "beta" version of bitcoin. Before compiling the code, we want to select a specific version, by checking out a release _tag_. This will synchronize the local copy with a specific snapshot of the code repository identified by a keyword tag. Tags are used by the developers to mark specific releases of the code by version number. First, to find the available tags, we use the +git tag+ command:

----
$ git tag
v0.1.5
v0.1.6test1
v0.2.0
v0.2.10
v0.2.11
v0.2.12

[... many more tags ...]

v0.8.4rc2
v0.8.5
v0.8.6
v0.8.6rc1
v0.9.0rc1
----

The list of tags shows all the released versions of bitcoin. By convention, _release candidates_, which are intended for testing, have the suffix "rc". Stable releases that can be run on production systems have no suffix. From the list above, we select the highest version release, which at this time is v0.9.0rc1. To synchronize the local code with this version, we use the +git checkout+ command:

----
$ git checkout v0.9.0rc1
Note: checking out 'v0.9.0rc1'.

HEAD is now at 15ec451... Merge pull request #3605
$
----


The source code includes documentation, which can be found in a number of files. Review the main documentation located in README.md in the bitcoin directory, by typing +more README.md+ at the prompt, using the space bar to progress to the next page. In this chapter we will build the command-line bitcoin client, also known as +bitcoind+ on Linux. Review the instructions for compiling the bitcoind command-line client on your platform by typing +more doc/build-unix.md+. Alternative instructions for Mac OSX and Windows can be found in the doc directory, as +build-os.md+ or +build-msw.md+ respectively. 

Carefully review the build pre-requisited which are in the first part of the build documentation. These are libraries that must be present on your system before you can begin to compile bitcoin. If these pre-requisites are missing the build process will fail with an error. If this happens because you missed a pre-requisite, you can install it and then resume the build process from where you left off. Assuming the pre-requisites are installed, we start the build process by generating a set of build scripts using the +autogen.sh+ script.

[TIP]
====
The bitcoind build process was changed to use the autogen/configure/make system starting with version 0.9. Older versions use a simple Makefile and work slightly differently from the example below. Follow the instructions for the version you want to compile. The autogen/configure/make introduced in 0.9 is likely to be the build system used for all future versions of the code and is the system demonstrated in the examples below.
====

----
$ ./autogen.sh 
configure.ac:12: installing `src/build-aux/config.guess'
configure.ac:12: installing `src/build-aux/config.sub'
configure.ac:37: installing `src/build-aux/install-sh'
configure.ac:37: installing `src/build-aux/missing'
src/Makefile.am: installing `src/build-aux/depcomp'
$ 
----

The +autogen.sh+ script creates a set of automatic configuation scripts that will interrogate your system to discover the correct settings and ensure you have all the necessary libraries to compile the code. The most important of these is the +configure+ script that offers a number of different options to customize the build process. Type +./configure --help+ to see the various options:

----
$ ./configure --help

`configure' configures Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit

[... many more options and variables are displayed below ...]

Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]

[... more options ...]

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

Report bugs to <info@bitcoin.org>.

$
----

The +configure+ script allows you to enable or disable certain features of bitcoind through the use of the +--enable-FEATURE+ and +--disable-FEATURE+ flags, where +FEATURE+ is replaced by the feature name, as listed in the help output above. In this chapter, we will build the bitcoind client with all the default features, so we won't be using these flags, but you should review them to understand what optional features are part of the client. Next, we run the +configure+ script to automatically discover all the necessary libraries and create a customized build script for our system:

----
$ ./configure 
checking build system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
checking host system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... no
checking for mawk... mawk
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes

[... many more system features are tested ...]

configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating src/Makefile
config.status: creating src/test/Makefile
config.status: creating src/qt/Makefile
config.status: creating src/qt/test/Makefile
config.status: creating share/setup.nsi
config.status: creating share/qt/Info.plist
config.status: creating qa/pull-tester/run-bitcoind-for-test.sh
config.status: creating qa/pull-tester/build-tests.sh
config.status: creating src/bitcoin-config.h
config.status: executing depfiles commands
$
----

If all goes well, the +configure+ command will end by creating the customized build scripts that will allow us to compile bitcoind. If there are any missing libraries or errors, the +configure+ command will terminate with an error instead of creating the build scripts as shown above. If an error occurs, it is most likely a missing or incompatible library. Review the build documentation again and make sure you install the missing pre-requisites, then run +configure+ again and see if that fixes the error. Next, we will compile the source code, a process that can take up to an hour to complete. During the compilation process you should see output every few seconds or every few minutes, or an error if something goes wrong. The compilation process can be resumed at any time if interrupted. Type +make+ to start compiling:

----
$ make
Making all in src
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/ubuntu/bitcoin/src'
make  all-recursive
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/ubuntu/bitcoin/src'

[... many more compilation messages follow ...]

make[1]: Entering directory `/home/ubuntu/bitcoin'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all-am'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/ubuntu/bitcoin'
$ 
----

If all goes well, bitcoind is now compiled. The final step is to install the bitcoind executable into the system path, using the +make+ command:

----
$ sudo make install
Making install in src
Making install in .
 /bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/bin'
  /usr/bin/install -c bitcoind bitcoin-cli '/usr/local/bin'
Making install in test
make  install-am
 /bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/bin'
  /usr/bin/install -c test_bitcoin '/usr/local/bin'
$
----

We can confirm that bitcoin is correctly installed, as follows:

----
$ which bitcoind
/usr/local/bin/bitcoind
----

The default installation of bitcoind puts it in +/usr/local/bin+. When we first run bitcoind it will remind us to create a configuration file with a strong password for the JSON-RPC interface. We run it by typing +bitcoind+ into the terminal:

----
$ bitcoind
Error: To use the "-server" option, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:
/home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
It is recommended you use the following random password:
rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=2XA4DuKNCbtZXsBQRRNDEwEY2nM6M4H9Tx5dFjoAVVbK
(you do not need to remember this password)
The username and password MUST NOT be the same.
If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.
It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;
for example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s "Bitcoin Alert" admin@foo.com
----

Edit the configuration file in your preferred editor and set the parameters, replacing the password with a strong password as recommended by bitcoind. Do *not* use the password shown below. Create a file inside the +.bitcoin+ directory, so that it is named +.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf+ and enter a username and password:

----
rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=7p687uGU8wMyBprB2aQrnt72r9Lh6jZy
----

Now, run the bitcoin client. The first time you run it, it will rebuild the bitcoin blockchain. This is a multi-gigabyte file and will take on average 2 days to download in full. You can shorten the blockchain initialization time by downloading a partial copy of the blockchain using bittorrent from +http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/blockchain/+. 

Run bitcoind in the background with the option +-daemon+:

----
$ bitcoind -daemon

=== Using bitcoind from the command line

The reference client bitcoind offers a number of commands that can be run from the command line. These are the same commands as those offered via the JSON-RPC API, so the command line allows us to experiment interactively with the capabilities that are also available programmatically. To start, we can invoke the +help+ command to see a list of the available bitcoin commands:

==== Command: bitcoind getinfo

Bitcoin's +getinfo+ command shows us basic information about the status of the bitcoin network node, the wallet and the blockchain database:

----
$ bitcoind getinfo
{
    "version" : 90000,
    "protocolversion" : 70002,
    "walletversion" : 60000,
    "balance" : 0.00000000,
    "blocks" : 286216,
    "timeoffset" : -72,
    "connections" : 4,
    "proxy" : "",
    "difficulty" : 2621404453.06461525,
    "testnet" : false,
    "keypoololdest" : 1374553827,
    "keypoolsize" : 101,
    "paytxfee" : 0.00000000,
    "errors" : ""
}
----

The data is returned as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a format which can easily be "consumed" by all programming languages but is also quite human-readable. Among this data we see the version of the bitcoin software client (9000), protocol (70002) and wallet file (60000). We see the current balance contained in the wallet, which is zero. We see the current block height, showing us how many blocks are known to this client, 286216. We also see various statistics about the bitcoin network and the settings related to this client. We will explore these settings in more detail in the rest of this chapter. 

[TIP]
====
It will take some time, perhaps more than a day, for the bitcoind client to "catch up" to the current blockchain height as it downloads blocks from other bitcoin clients. You can check its current progress using getinfo to see the number of known blocks.
====

==== Commands: bitcoind encryptwallet, walletpassphrase

Before we proceed with creating keys and other commands, we will first encrypt the wallet with a password. For this example, we use the +encryptwallet+ command with the password "foo". Obviously, replace "foo" with a strong and complex password!

----
$ bitcoind encryptwallet foo
wallet encrypted; Bitcoin server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed, you need to make a new backup.
$
----

We can verify the wallet has been encrypted, by running +getinfo+ again. This time you will notice a new entry +unlocked_until+ which is a counter showing how long the wallet decryption password will be stored in memory, keeping the wallet unlocked. At first this will be set to zero, meaning the wallet is locked:

----
$ bitcoind getinfo
{
    "version" : 90000,

[... other information...]

    "unlocked_until" : 0,
    "errors" : ""
}
$
----

To unlock the wallet, we issue the +walletpassphrase+ command that takes two parameters, the password and a number of seconds until the wallet is locked again automatically (a time counter):

----
$ bitcoind walletpassphrase foo 360
$
----

Confirm the wallet is unlocked and see the timeout by running +getinfo+ again:

----
$ bitcoind getinfo
{
    "version" : 90000,

[... other information ...]

    "unlocked_until" : 1392580909,
    "errors" : ""
}
----

==== Commands: backupwallet, importwallet, dumpwallet

Next, we will practice creating a wallet backup file and then restoring the wallet from the backup file. Use the +backupwallet+ command to backup, providing the file name as the parameter. Here we backup the wallet to the file +wallet.backup+:

----
$ bitcoind backupwallet wallet.backup
$
----

Now, to restore the backup file, use the +importwallet+ command. If your wallet is locked, you will need to unlock it first (see +walletpassphrase+ above) in order to import the backup file:

----
$ bitcoind importwallet wallet.backup
$
----

The +dumpwallet+ command can be used to dump the wallet into a text file that is human-readable:

----
$ bitcoind dumpwallet wallet.txt
$ more wallet.txt
# Wallet dump created by Bitcoin v0.9.0rc1-beta (2014-01-31 09:30:15 +0100)
